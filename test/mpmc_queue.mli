(** Multi-producer, multi-consummer, thread-safe unbounded queue. *)

type 'a t
(** A queue of items of type ['a]. *)

val make : ?capacity:int -> unit -> 'a t
(** [make ()] creates a new empty queue.

    The optional parameter [?capacity] defaults to 4096 and is used to size the
    internal buffers of the queue: Choosing a small number lower the pause
    durations caused by allocations, but a larger capacity provides overall
    faster operations. *)

val push : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
(** [push t x] adds [x] to the tail of the queue. *)

val pop : 'a t -> 'a option
(** [pop t] removes the head item from [t] and returns it.
    Returns [None] if [t] is currently empty. *)

val await_pop : pool:Domainslib.Task.pool -> 'a t -> 'a
(** [pop t] removes the head item from [t] and returns it. *)
